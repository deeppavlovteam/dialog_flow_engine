# Here we will consider different options for setting responses.

# The response is set by any object of python:
#
# - collable objects - If the object is callable, then it must have a special signature:
#                      func`(ctx: Context, actor: Actor, *args, **kwargs) -> Any`
#                      Then this object will be called with the appropriate arguments.
#
# - non-callable objects - If the object is not callable,
#                          then the object will be returned by the agent as a response.


# Out of the box, df_engine offers 1 additional response function:
# - `choice` - will return `true` if the user's request completely matches the value passed to the function.
